## 🏗️ The Big Picture: How This Works

This system is a **Quant Trading Engine**. It automates the process of finding trading strategies and executing them. Here is the workflow:

1.  **Data Acquisition:** We download historical price data (candles) from IBKR. *You can't test a strategy without history.*
2.  **Strategy Discovery:** We use **VectorBT** to simulate thousands of trading rules (e.g., "Buy when RSI is low") on that history to find what actually makes money.
3.  **Machine Learning:** We train AI models to recognize complex patterns that simple rules miss.
4.  **Live Trading:** We turn on **NautilusTrader**, which connects to IBKR (TWS or Gateway), watches the market in real-time, and executes the winning strategies.

---

## 🚀 Phase 1: Getting Started (Installation)

### Prerequisites (What you need)
1.  **A Computer:** Windows, Mac, or Linux.
2.  **Python 3.11+:** The programming language we use. [Download Here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3.  **VS Code:** A good code editor. [Download Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
4.  **Interactive Brokers Account & TWS/Gateway:** You need an account to trade. Start with a **Paper Account** (Play Money).
    - Download and install [IB Gateway](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/ibgateway.php) or [TWS (Trader Workstation)](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/tws.php).
    - Log in to your Paper Trading account.
    - Go to Settings -> API -> Settings.
    - Check "Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients".
    - Uncheck "Read-Only API".
    - Note the **Socket port** (usually `4002` for Paper Gateway, `7497` for Paper TWS).

### Step 1: Download the Code
Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rayan-azhari/Titan_IBKR.git
cd Titan_IBKR
```

### Step 2: Install the Brains (Dependencies)
We need to install the libraries that do the math.

```bash
# First, install 'uv' (it makes things faster)
pip install uv

# Install the Titan package in editable mode
uv pip install -e .
```
*Tip: If `uv` doesn't work, just use `pip install -e .`*

### Step 3: Connect Your Account
We need to tell the system how to connect to your IBKR TWS/Gateway.

1.  Copy the example credentials file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2.  Open `.env` in VS Code.
3.  Update the connection details if necessary (by default it assumes Gateway Paper port 4002):
    ```env
    IBKR_HOST=127.0.0.1
    IBKR_PORT=4002
    IBKR_CLIENT_ID=1
    IBKR_ACCOUNT_ID=DUxxxxxxx  # Add your specific paper account here
    ```

**Sanity Check:**
Make sure TWS or IB Gateway is running and logged in.
Run this verification script. If it works, you are ready to go!
```bash
uv run python scripts/verify_connection.py
```
✅ **Success:** You see "IBKR Connection Verified ✓ [Port: 4002]".
❌ **Failure:** "Connection timed out". Check that TWS/Gateway is running and the API port matches your `.env` setting.

---

## 📊 Phase 2: Get the Data

We cannot trade without knowing what the market did in the past.

**The Command:**
```bash
uv run python scripts/download_data.py
```

> **Note:** When running **Live Strategies** (Phase 5), this step runs **automatically**. You only need to run this manually for backtesting or research.

**What it does:**
- Downloads price candles (Open, High, Low, Close) for major currency pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, etc.).
- Saves them as **Parquet** files (highly efficient data files) in the `data/` folder.

**Sanity Check:**
- Look in the `data/raw/` folder. You should see files like `EUR_USD_M15.parquet`.
- If the folder is empty, the download failed. Check your internet or API limits.

---

## 🧪 Phase 3: Find a Winning Strategy (Backtesting)

Now we play "What If?". What if we bought every time RSI was below 30 last year? Would we be rich?

**The Command:**
```bash
uv run python research/alpha_loop/run_vbt_optimisation.py
```

**What it does:**
- Uses **VectorBT** to run thousands of simulations.
- It tests different combinations (e.g., RSI Period 14 vs 21, Threshold 30 vs 25).
- It generates a **Heatmap** showing which settings were profitable.

**Sanity Check:**
- Look in `reports/`. Open `sharpe_heatmap_EUR_USD_RSI.html` in your web browser.
- Green areas = Profitable settings. Red areas = Loss-making settings.

---

## 🔗 Phase 3.5: Feature Selection Bridge (VBT → ML)

This is the **Titan Sequence** — the bridge between simple backtesting and intelligent ML. Instead of feeding the ML model hardcoded indicators, we first use VBT to discover *which* indicator parameters actually work, then feed those into the ML pipeline automatically.

**The Command:**
```bash
uv run python research/alpha_loop/run_feature_selection.py
```

**What it does:**
1. **Single-TF Indicator Sweep** — Tests 7 indicator families across hundreds of parameter combos:

   | Indicator | What it sweeps |
   |---|---|
   | RSI | Window 5–30, entry threshold 15–40 |
   | SMA Cross | Fast 5–30, slow 20–100 |
   | EMA Cross | Fast 5–25, slow 15–60 |
   | MACD | Fast/slow/signal combinations |
   | Bollinger | Window 10–30, std dev 1.5–3.0 |
   | Stochastic | %K 5–21, %D 2–5 |
   | ADX Filter | Period 10–25, threshold 20–30 |

2. **MTF Confluence Sweep** — Tests higher-timeframe bias filters:
   - Which TFs to use as context (D, W, or both)
   - SMA fast/slow speeds on each higher TF
   - RSI period and bullish/bearish threshold per TF

3. **Scoring** — Each combo is backtested on both In-Sample (70%) and Out-of-Sample (30%) data. Scored by:
   - `Stability = min(IS, OOS) / max(IS, OOS)` — penalises overfitting
   - `Score = OOS_Sharpe × Stability` — rewards robust profitability

4. **Auto-Config** — Writes the winning parameters to `config/features.toml`

**Sanity Check:**
- Open `config/features.toml` — you should see tuned values like `rsi = { window = 9, entry = 28 }`
- Open `reports/feature_scoreboard_EUR_USD.json` — all indicators ranked by score

## 📈 Phase 3.6: Gaussian Channel Strategy

The **Gaussian Channel** is a volatility-based indicator from the Ehlers Gaussian Filter. Instead of simple moving averages, it uses a cascade of EMAs (controlled by the "poles" parameter) to create a smoother, lower-lag channel. This is useful for catching momentum breakouts and trend-following bounces.

**The Command:**
```bash
uv run python research/gaussian/run_optimisation.py
```

**What it does:**
1. Loads EUR/USD H1 data from `data/`.
2. Runs the `GaussianChannel` indicator across a parameter grid:

   | Parameter | Range |
   |---|---|
   | Period | 50 – 300 (step 10) |
   | Poles | 1, 2, 3, 4 |
   | Sigma | 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 |

3. **Signal Logic:**
   - **Long:** Price crosses above Upper Band (momentum breakout) OR bounces off Middle Line (trend following).
   - **Short:** Price crosses below Lower Band.
4. Calculates Sharpe Ratio for each combo.
5. Saves the best parameters to `config/gaussian_channel_config.toml`.
6. Generates an interactive **Heatmap** (Poles vs Period, coloured by Sharpe).

**Sanity Check:**
- Open `config/gaussian_channel_config.toml` — you should see tuned values like `period = 140`, `poles = 3`, `sigma = 2.0`.
- Open `.tmp/reports/gaussian_channel_heatmap.html` in your browser to see the heatmap.
- Open `.tmp/reports/gaussian_channel_scoreboard.csv` for the full results table.

## 🦅 Phase 3.7: Multi-Timeframe Confluence (Deep Dive)

This is our **flagship strategy** (Sharpe 1.75+ on EUR/USD). It solves the "noise" problem by requiring alignment across Daily (Trend), H4 (Swing), and H1 (Entry) timeframes.

### 🧠 The Logic
We calculate a **Confluence Score** (-1.0 to +1.0) based on weighted signals from each timeframe:

$$ \text{Score} = (0.6 \times D) + (0.25 \times H4) + (0.1 \times H1) + (0.05 \times W) $$

Each timeframe votes **Long (+1)**, **Short (-1)**, or **Neutral (0)** based on:
1.  **Trend:** Fast SMA > Slow SMA
2.  **Momentum:** RSI > 50 (Bullish) or RSI < 50 (Bearish)

**Signals:**
-   **Long:** Score ≥ **+0.10**
-   **Short:** Score ≤ **-0.10**
-   **Exit:** Score returns to Neutral (between -0.1 and +0.1)

### 🔬 The Research Workflow (How we built it)
We didn't guess these parameters. We used a **3-Stage Optimization Process** located in `research/mtf/`.

#### Stage 1: Core Signal Optimization
Finds the best moving average type (SMA vs EMA) and signal thresholds.
```bash
uv run python research/mtf/run_optimisation.py
```
*Result: SMA is superior to EMA; low threshold (0.1) beats high threshold (0.3).*

#### Stage 2: Weight Optimization
Determines which timeframe matters most. We simulated thousands of weight combinations.
```bash
uv run python research/mtf/run_stage2.py
```
*Result: Daily timeframe governs 60% of price action validity.*

#### Stage 3: Period Tuning (The Finetuning)
Optimizes the specific lookback periods (e.g., Daily SMA 13 vs 20) for the current market regime.
```bash
uv run python research/mtf/run_stage3.py
```
*Output: Automatically updates `config/mtf.toml` with the best settings.*

#### Stage 4: Out-of-Sample Validation
Verifies that the strategy isn't overfitting by running it on unseen data.
```bash
uv run python research/mtf/run_validation.py
```

### 📊 Portfolio Analysis
Want to see how this strategy performs across **all** pairs simultaneously?
```bash
uv run python research/mtf/run_portfolio.py
```
*Generates a correlation matrix and combined equity curve to test diversification.*

### ⚙️ Configuration
The strategy reads from `config/mtf.toml`. You can manually tweak it, but we recommend letting `run_stage3.py` manage it.

```toml
[eur_usd]
weights = { D = 0.6, H4 = 0.25, H1 = 0.1, W = 0.05 }
lower_threshold = -0.1
upper_threshold = 0.1
```

## 🧠 Phase 4: Train the AI (Machine Learning)

## 🧠 Phase 4: Train the AI (Machine Learning)

This phase turns your research into a predictive model. The workflow is designed to be seamless: **Research (Phase 3.5) → Training (Phase 4)**.

### Step-by-Step Workflow

1.  **Ensure Feature Selection is Complete:**
    Before training, you must run the feature selection step (Phase 3.5) to identify the best indicators for the current market conditions.
    ```bash
    uv run python research/alpha_loop/run_feature_selection.py
    ```
    *Output:* This updates `config/features.toml`.

2.  **Run the ML Pipeline:**
    The pipeline reads your tuned features, builds a 3-class target (Long/Short/Flat), and trains models using Walk-Forward Cross-Validation.
    ```bash
    uv run python research/ml/run_pipeline.py
    ```

3.  **Review the Report:**
    Check the output in `.tmp/reports/`. Look for an **OOS Sharpe > 1.0** and **Win Rate > 50%**.

**What the Pipeline Does:**
1.  **Loads Config:** Reads tuned indicator parameters from `config/features.toml`.
2.  **Builds Features:** Generates the feature matrix (RSI, SMA, MACD, Bollinger, Stochastic, ADX, MTF bias).
3.  **Engineers Target:** Creates a 3-class target (LONG, SHORT, FLAT).
4.  **Trains Models:** Trains GradientBoosting and RandomForest classifiers via walk-forward cross-validation.
5.  **Backtests:** Simulates trading the model's predictions using VectorBT on Out-of-Sample data.
6.  **Saves Model:** Automatically saves the best model to `models/` (e.g., `ml_strategy_H4_gradientboosting_20231027.joblib`).

**Sanity Check:**
- Look in `models/`. You should see `.joblib` files.
- Creating these files means your AI is ready to make decisions.

## 🦅 Phase 5.5: MTF Confluence Live (Recommended)

For the **Multi-Timeframe Confluence Strategy** (our robust, signal-based logic), use the dedicated runner. This is simpler and more reliable than the ML pipeline for this specific strategy.

**The Command:**
```bash
uv run python scripts/run_live_mtf.py
```

**What it does:**
1.  **Auto-Download:** Runs `scripts/download_data.py` to get latest candles.
2.  **Connects:** Authenticates with IBKR (Practice).
3.  **Loads Instruments:** Fetches available pairs.
4.  **Warms Up:** Loads local Parquet data (`data/raw/`) to calculate moving averages immediately.
5.  **Trades:** Executes Long/Short positions based on the H1/H4/D/W confluence score.

---

## 💸 Phase 5: Live Trading

This is it. The system connects to IBKR and trades for real.

**⚠️ DANGER ZONE:**
- By default, we use **Paper Trading**.
- To trade real money, you must login to your LIVE account in TWS/Gateway and update the `.env` file port to the live socket port (usually `4001` or `7496`). **DO NOT DO THIS UNTIL YOU ARE SURE.**

**Choose Your Strategy:**

**Option A: ML Strategy (The Big Gun)**
```bash
uv run python scripts/run_live_ml.py
```
*Uses the latest .joblib model trained by the ML pipeline from `models/`.*

**Option B: MTF Confluence Strategy (The Reliable One)**
```bash
uv run python scripts/run_live_mtf.py
```
*Uses the H1+H4+D+W trend confluence logic. Prints a status dashboard every hour.*

**What Happens Next:**
1.  **Data Sync:** Automatically downloads latest data (for **ALL** strategies).
2.  **Connection:** The system connects to IBKR.
3.  **Warmup:** It loads recent data from `data/` to calculate indicators immediately.
4.  **Reconciliation:** It checks if you have existing positions and syncs them.
5.  **Trading:** It streams live prices (`QUOTE EUR.USD.IBKR...`) and executes trades when signals align.

**Monitoring:**
- **Logs:** Check `.tmp/logs/` for detailed files like `mtf_live_*.log`.
- **Console:** Watch the live output for status dashboards and trade info.
- **Process Check:** open a new terminal and run:
  ```powershell
  Get-Process -Name "python"
  ```

**How to Stop:**
- Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.
- OR run this in another terminal:
  ```powershell
  Get-Process -Name "python" | Stop-Process -Force
  ```

## 🚨 Emergency: The Kill Switch

If the bot goes crazy or you just want out **NOW**.

**The Command:**
```bash
uv run python scripts/kill_switch.py
```

**What it does:**
1.  **Cancels** all pending orders.
2.  **Closes** all open trades immediately (at market price).
3.  **Stops** everything.

---

**Success Criteria:**
- You see `✅ STRESS TEST COMPLETE`.
- No "Order Not Found" errors.

---

## � Optional: Set Up Slack Alerts

Want the bot to message you when it trades?

1.  **Create a Slack App:** Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and click **Create New App** -> **From scratch**. Name it "Titan Bot" and pick your workspace.
2.  **Activate Webhooks:** Click **Incoming Webhooks** in the sidebar and toggle it **On**.
3.  **Add Webhook:** Click **Add New Webhook to Workspace**, pick a channel (e.g., `#trading-logs`), and click **Allow**.
4.  **Copy the URL:** It looks like `https://hooks.slack.com/services/T000.../B000.../XXXX...`.
5.  **Save it:** Add it to your `.env` file manually:
    ```bash
    SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/...
    ```

---

## �🐳 Advanced: Running in the Cloud (Docker)

If you want the bot to run 24/7 without your laptop being on, you use **Docker**.

1.  **Build the Container:**
    ```bash
    uv run python scripts/build_docker.py
    ```
2.  **Run It:**
    ```bash
    docker run --env-file .env titan-ibkr-algo
    ```

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline & Code Quality

Every time you push code to GitHub, an automated **CI/CD pipeline** runs to check your code quality and test suite. If it fails, your changes are flagged as broken. **Always run these checks locally before pushing.**

### What the Pipeline Checks

The CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs three checks:

| Step | Command | What it Checks |
|---|---|---|
| **Ruff Linter** | `uv run ruff check .` | Import errors, unused variables, naming rules |
| **Ruff Formatter** | `uv run ruff format --check .` | Code formatting (spacing, quotes, trailing commas) |
| **Pytest** | `uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short -x` | Unit tests pass |

### How to Run Checks Locally (Pre-Push Checklist)

**Always run these 3 commands before pushing:**

```bash
# Step 1: Install test dependencies (only needed once)
uv sync --extra dev

# Step 2: Fix lint errors
uv run ruff check . --fix

# Step 3: Auto-format code
uv run ruff format .

# Step 4: Run tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

If all 3 pass locally with **zero errors**, the CI pipeline will also pass.

### Common CI Failures & Fixes

**1. `E402 Module level import not at top of file`**
- **Cause:** Imports appear after `sys.path.insert()` or `load_dotenv()` calls.
- **Fix:** Already suppressed for `execution/*.py` and `tests/*` in `pyproject.toml`. If adding new files, ensure they follow the same pattern or add them to the `per-file-ignores` section.

**2. `F841 Local variable is assigned to but never used`**
- **Cause:** You assigned a variable but never read it.
- **Fix:** Remove it, or prefix with `_` (e.g., `_unused_var = ...`).

**3. `E501 Line too long`**
- **Cause:** A line exceeds 100 characters.
- **Fix:** Break the line. Use parentheses for multi-line strings.

**4. `ImportError` in tests**
- **Cause:** NautilusTrader API changed (classes moved to new modules).
- **Fix:** Check the [NautilusTrader docs](https://nautilustrader.io/docs) for updated import paths. Common moves:
  - `LiveDataClient` → `nautilus_trader.live.data_client`
  - `LiveExecutionClient` → `nautilus_trader.live.execution_client`
  - `CurrencyPair` → `nautilus_trader.model.instruments.currency_pair`

**5. `TypeError` in NautilusTrader objects**
- **Cause:** Constructor signatures changed between versions.
- **Fix:** Use factory methods instead of direct constructors:
  - `Price.from_str("1.05")` instead of `Price(Decimal("1.05"))`
  - `Quantity.from_str("100")` instead of `Quantity(100, 0)`
  - `CurrencyPair.from_dict({...})` instead of `CurrencyPair(...)`

**6. `Would reformat: file.py` (Formatter)**
- **Cause:** Code isn't formatted to Ruff's standard (quotes, spacing, etc.).
- **Fix:** Run `uv run ruff format .` — it auto-formats everything.

### Ruff Configuration

All linting and formatting rules are configured in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.ruff]`:

```toml
[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["E", "F", "I", "W", "D"]  # Enabled rule categories
ignore = ["D100", "D102", "D103", "D104", "D107", "D205", "D415", "D417"]

[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]
"tests/*" = ["E402", "D"]           # Tests: allow late imports
"execution/*.py" = ["E402"]         # Scripts: allow sys.path before imports
"strategies/*" = ["D"]              # Strategies: skip docstring rules
```

If you add a new directory with Python files, you may need to add it here.

## ❓ Troubleshooting / FAQ

**Q: "Command not found: uv"**
A: You didn't install `uv`. Try `pip install uv` again. Or just use `python` instead of `uv run python`.

**Q: "Connection timed out"**
A: Ensure your IB Gateway or TWS is running and configured to accept socket connections on the configured port. Go to Settings -> API -> Settings -> check "Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients".

**Q: "ConnectionResetError"**
A: IBKR disconnected you. The script usually reconnects automatically. If it happens at a specific time daily, remember that IBKR restarts its servers every night.

**Q: "401 Unauthorized" or Account errors**
A: Ensure your `IBKR_ACCOUNT_ID` matches the account currently logged into TWS/Gateway.

**Q: "TypeError: Cannot convert InteractiveBrokersDataClient..."**
A: Check that Nautilus internal dependency is satisfied. You might have Nautilus version conflicts.

**Q: I don't see any trades!**
A: The market might be closed (Weekends). Or the strategy just hasn't found a good setup yet. Be patient.

**Q: CI pipeline fails with "Would reformat"**
A: Run `uv run ruff format .` locally, commit, and push again. The formatter auto-fixes all formatting.

**Q: CI pipeline fails with "ruff check" errors**
A: Run `uv run ruff check . --fix` locally. It auto-fixes most issues. For remaining errors, read the error message — it tells you the exact file, line, and what's wrong.

**Q: Tests pass locally but fail in CI**
A: Check if you have `.env` variables that tests depend on. CI doesn't have your `.env` file, so tests requiring live IBKR credentials are auto-skipped. If tests fail for a different reason, check the CI logs for the exact error.

**Q: Feature Selection sweep is slow**
A: The sweep tests ~1,200+ parameter combos across 7 indicators + MTF confluence. On H4 data with ~2 years of history, expect 5–15 minutes per pair. To speed up, reduce the parameter ranges in `run_feature_selection.py` (e.g., widen the step sizes).

**Q: `config/features.toml` shows all defaults, nothing tuned**
A: No indicator passed the minimum OOS Sharpe threshold (0.3). This means the asset/timeframe may not have strong single-indicator signals. Try a different pair or timeframe, or lower `min_sharpe_oos`.
